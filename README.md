## 🎯 What This Does

BalanceHeat Hub is not a chat app. It's a **psychological infrastructure** that:

- 🎤 Analyzes a 60-second voice sample to detect emotional state
- 🧠 Uses **AI-powered matching** to find your emotional opposite (not your clone)
- 📞 Connects you for a **7-minute anonymous audio call**
- ⏳ Forces a **5-minute cooldown** before rating (removes knee-jerk reactions)
- 💰 Rewards helpful users with **"Attentive Minutes"** (a currency for attention)
- 🔥 Tracks **"Heat" scores** (reputation that gives priority queueing)
- 👑 Awards **"Golden Earbud"** badges to top advisors (double minutes!)
- 🆘 Provides **"Emergency Mode"** for users in crisis (skip the queue)
- 📝 Has a **Reflection Journal** for private post-call notes
- 📊 Tracks **mood history** to show your emotional journey
- 🏆 Features a **Community Leaderboard** for top users
- 🔐 Includes **Phone Verification** for a safer community

---

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

> *"We don't match similarities. We match complementary suffering."*

When you're overwhelmed, you don't need someone who agrees with you. You need someone who can offer a completely different perspective. BalanceHeat Hub finds that person using emotional distance calculations.

SELECT 
  COUNT(*) AS total_calls,
  SUM(CASE WHEN ended_early = true THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS panic_ends,

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

- **Zero personal data**: No emails, no names, no phone numbers (unless you verify)
- **Audio processed on-device**: Voice embeddings never leave the user's phone
- **No recordings**: We never store call audio
- **Anonymous by design**: Users are identified only by UUIDs
- **Optional verification**: Phone verification is optional but recommended
